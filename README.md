## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### üìå Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python **3.8+**
- Node.js **14+**
- MongoDB

### üöÄ Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/TommyTheHuman/MeepleStats.git
   cd MeepleStats/backend
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure it (see [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables))

5. Run the backend server:
   ```sh
   python run.py
   ```

### üé® Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```sh
   cd ../frontend/meeplestats
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure it (see [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables))

4. Start the frontend development server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

### ‚ñ≤ Vercel Installation
Just create two different projects in **Vercel** and do the correct environment variables setup, the `.JSON` config files for Vercel are provided

### üê≥ Docker Deployment (Pre-built Images)

The project now includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and publishes Docker images for both the backend and frontend to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). This allows you to deploy the application without building the images locally.

#### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose must be installed on your deployment system.
- Ensure your `.env` file is configured properly and placed in the project root.

#### Deployment Instructions

1. **Clone the repository to your server (or pull the latest changes):**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/TommyTheHuman/MeepleStats.git
   cd MeepleStats
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root with all required settings (see [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) below).

3. **Deploy using Docker Compose:**

   The provided `docker-compose.yml` uses the pre-built images from GHCR. 
   
   To deploy, simply run:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access the Application:**
   - The backend will be available on port 5000.
   - The frontend will be accessible on port 5173.

## Additional Dockge Instructions

Instructions for Dockge:
In your stacks folder, pull repo from GitHub:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/TommyTheHuman/MeepleStats.git
   ```

Then rename the pulled folder:
   ```sh
mv MeepleStats meeplestats
  ```

Then in dockge, pull and update to pull the latest configurations and update. Missing this step could result in unexpected failures. 


### Notes

- If changes are made to the code, the GitHub workflow will automatically build and push updated images to GHCR upon merges or pushes to `main`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Open your browser and navigate to the provided URL to access the frontend.
Use the provided API endpoints to interact with the backend.
Decide where to store the `JWT Token`: you can use either cookies or your browser's local storage. Make sure to set up the [Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) correctly.
Additionally, you can choose where to store images from your game nights. You can either save them locally or use Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3). In either case, ensure that the relevant variables are configured correctly.

---

## üìö Rulebook Chat (RAG System)
The Rulebook Chat feature lets you upload board game rulebooks as PDFs and then ask questions about game rules without manually searching through pages. Simply upload a rulebook for your game, then ask questions like "How do I set up the game?" or "What happens when two players tie?" The system will find the relevant sections in the rulebook and provide specific answers with page references, making it easy to resolve rule questions during gameplay.

---

## üßÆ Score Sheet System
The Score Sheet Creator helps you track complex game scoring without pen and paper. Create custom score sheets for games by defining scoring categories with different types (numbers or text) and rules. During gameplay, anyone can access the Score Sheet page, select a game, add players, and track scores in real-time. The system automatically calculates totals and displays scoring rules when needed. This feature is perfect for games with multiple scoring categories, helping you focus on the fun rather than the math.

If you want to contribute, you can submit with a PR new configs to create a score sheets database.
